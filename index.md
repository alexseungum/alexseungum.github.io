Hi, I'm Alex! 👋 I'm a Junior at the University of California, Berkeley studying [EECS](https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu) and [IEOR](https://www.ieor.berkeley.edu) 📚.

One of my passions is teaching: I have been on course staff for [EECS 16A](https://www.eecs16a.org) 🔌 for 3 semesters, and a mentor for [Computer Science Mentors](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu) 🌱 for 4, where I create [questions](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OBa0d3eBLdMFivzQ05zMrnG_cEp6GpR-?usp=drive_link) and teach students.

My technical passions are in Machine Learning and Computer Architecture, and I am looking for opportunities to build my knowledge and skills in these fields.

You can find me going 8th in [tft](https://teamfighttactics.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/) 🎲, big braining board/[card games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_(card_game)) ♠️, or playing the piano 🎹 

I'm always interested in talking, so feel free to reach out!
