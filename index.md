Hi, I'm Alex! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Junior at the University of California, Berkeley studying [EECS](https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu) and [IEOR](https://www.ieor.berkeley.edu) ðŸ“š.

I have a passion for teaching. I have been on course staff for [EECS 16A](https://www.eecs16a.org) ðŸ”Œ for 3 semesters, and a mentor for [Computer Science Mentors](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu) ðŸŒ± for 4, where I create [questions](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OBa0d3eBLdMFivzQ05zMrnG_cEp6GpR-?usp=drive_link) and teach students.

My technical interests are in Machine Learning and Computer Architecture. I'm always interested in talking, so feel free to reach out!
